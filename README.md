# ipam
A cli based [IP Address Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_management)
built with [Go](https://go.dev/) using [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) and
[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) with optional [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/auth.html)
API integration.

## Features
`ipam` is a cli based IPAM. It supports:
- Adding, listing, viewing and deleting subnets
- Adding, viewing and deleting single IP addresses with FQDNs
- automatic addition and deletion of forward and reverse records
- import and export configuration

## But why?
In my career as a Network Engineer I worked at a company that developed their own internal CMDB
that was set up as a cli application. I really liked the ease of use and the way you could
quickly do stuff.

So I sat down and started my first Go project and started developing this ipam.

## How do I use the cmdb?
Coming soon

## How can I contribute to the development?
